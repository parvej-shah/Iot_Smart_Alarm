# Weight Sensor Integration Summary

## üõèÔ∏è **NEW WEIGHT SENSOR FUNCTIONALITY ADDED**

### **Virtual Pin V0 - Weight Sensor (Bed Detection)**
- **V0 = 1**: Person is in bed (Weight detected)
- **V0 = 0**: Person is out of bed (No weight detected)

### **Virtual Pin V6 - Bed Status Display**
- Shows "In Bed" or "Out of Bed" status for monitoring

## üö® **UPDATED ALARM LOGIC**

### **Alarm Stop Sequence (BOTH conditions required):**
1. **Step 1**: Get out of bed (V0=0) 
2. **Step 2**: Go to washroom and show face (V4=1)
3. **Result**: Alarm stops and V5=0

### **Alarm Continue Conditions:**
- If person is in bed (V0=1) ‚Üí Alarm continues regardless of face detection
- If person gets out of bed (V0=0) but no face shown ‚Üí Alarm continues until face detection
- Only when BOTH out of bed AND face detected ‚Üí Alarm stops

## üîß **HARDWARE CONNECTIONS**

### **Status LED (Pin 19):**
- **ON**: When person is in bed (V0=1)
- **OFF**: When person is out of bed (V0=0)

### **Weight Sensor Simulation:**
- Use Blynk app V0 switch to simulate weight sensor
- Toggle switch to test in bed / out of bed scenarios

## üì± **BLYNK APP SETUP**

Add these widgets to your Blynk app:
1. **V0**: Switch widget (Weight Sensor Simulation)
2. **V6**: Value Display widget (Bed Status)

## üéØ **REALISTIC TESTING SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario 1: Normal Wake-up Sequence**
1. Alarm triggers ‚Üí Person in bed
2. Get out of bed (V0=0) ‚Üí Alarm continues, shows "Go to washroom"
3. Go to washroom and show face (V4=1) ‚Üí Alarm stops ‚úÖ

### **Scenario 2: Still in Bed**
1. Alarm triggers ‚Üí Person in bed
2. Stays in bed ‚Üí Alarm continues, shows "Get out of bed first!"
3. Must get out of bed to proceed

### **Scenario 3: Already Out of Bed**
1. Alarm triggers ‚Üí Person already out of bed  
2. Shows "Go to washroom and show your face!"
3. Show face ‚Üí Alarm stops ‚úÖ

**Note**: The system doesn't expect face detection while in bed, as this would be unrealistic. People naturally get out of bed first, then go to washroom.

## üìä **UPDATED VIRTUAL PIN MAP**

| Pin | Function | Direction | Description |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------------|
| V0 | Weight Sensor | Input | 1=In Bed, 0=Out of Bed |
| V1 | Time Input | Input | Alarm time setting |
| V2 | Status Display | Output | System messages |
| V3 | Current Time | Output | Real-time clock |
| V4 | Face Detection | Input | From laptop camera |
| V5 | Alarm Status | Output | To laptop audio |
| V6 | Bed Status | Output | In Bed / Out of Bed |

## ‚úÖ **READY TO TEST**

The weight sensor simulation is now integrated and ready for testing. Upload the updated code to your ESP32 and test with the Blynk app!
